## Usage

- **Initial Study:**
    
    - You must study the tome for a total of 24 hours before you gain its bonuses.
        
    - This time can be split into multiple sessions (e.g., 4 hours per day for 6 days).
        
    - If you study all 24 hours at once, you risk fatigue (as per the forced march rules in the PHB).
        
- **Increasing the Bonus:**
    
    - **After the initial study, for every additional 24 hours of focused study (up to a total of 240 hours), you may increase the competence bonus by +1, to a maximum of +10.**
        
    - **This means you can reach the maximum +10 competence bonus after 240 hours (10 x 24 hours) of study beyond the initial 24 hours.**
        
- **Weekly Maintenance:**
    
    - After the initial study, you must study the tome for at least 1 hour each week.
        
    - If you fail to do so, you take a cumulative –2 penalty to the bonus for each week missed, until the bonus is lost.
        
    - Each hour of study removes a –2 penalty.
        
- **Quick Research:**
    
    - If you haven’t studied the tome but have access to it, you can spend 1 hour researching to gain the bonus for a single check.
        
    - Quick research cannot be used in time-sensitive situations (such as combat or social encounters).
        
    - Each hour of quick research counts toward the initial 24-hour study requirement.
